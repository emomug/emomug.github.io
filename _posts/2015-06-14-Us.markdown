summary:    I would have wanted to say this in words... but my awkwardness would come in the way.

Hi R,

When I first met you a couple months ago... I didn't have much to believe in. I can't really say why that is. Maybe it's because I was experiencing all these new things and people and my brain was stuck trying to figure it all out. I was trying to figure everything out myself, but try as I might... I still felt like I was going nowhere.

I guess it was like being a planet or moon which sees a spacecraft coming out of space towards it. The spacecraft comes closer and closer and the planet longingly reaches out with its gravity... trying to bring it closer. But then... just when the planet has the spacecraft at its closest, it speeds off... faster than it came. In the process, the planet doesn't just lose the spacecraft... but loses some of its orbital energy in the process.

You changed a lot of things though. You reminded me that even though gravity is inevitable and we're all stuck in the rat-race, we can find silver linings everywhere. You showed me the excited faces of the scientists on earth who'd figured out how to speed up their craft without using any fuel and that other people's happiness is sometimes just as important as our own. You showed that even though some things (spaceships, reading, writing and fun) slow us down a wee bit... most times the change is infinitesimal and it helps us gain new perspective of the universe around us.

I think the only problem is that I wasn't entirely honest with you... or, to put it in a better way, I danced around the truth. The truth is that despite all my logic and rational thought, there's something within me that remains convinced that this life can't just be as futile and temporal as it seems. I believe that the world around us is too great, complex and beautiful to be the result of chaos. I believe that we have a Creator. I'm not bold enough to say that I understand even a fraction of what He is or could be... But I believe that He's out there... and that He has a plan.

The plot thickens, because I'm biased towards a certain portrayal of God... the one I've been given ever since I was born: A kind and loving Father who wants the best for his stubborn and disobedient children. This Father has a lot of rules... which sucks... especially because a lot of them make sense. It also sucks that a lot of people twist His rules around to meet their own selfish needs. However, an inescapable fact is that this God offers the promise of some sort of **purpose**.

> For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.
>
> **Jeremiah 29:11**

The thing about this God is that He doesn't really give a lot of routes to the truth. The route He gives isn't really the happiest and fun-filled. Perhaps you remember the verse that we saw on the wall that day:

> Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
>
> **John 14:6**

I used to like this verse a lot when I was younger, because it gave me assurance that I was headed in the right direction. Lately it has caused me a lot of frustration and confusion. The reason is because I've been afforded the chance to meet a lot more people since I was a child and many of these people were good, kind and beautiful... even though they didn't believe the same things I did. This presented two options: Perhaps they were absolutely wrong and headed for destruction, or maybe their hearts were always in the right place. This is illustrated beautifully by C.S. Lewis in the last battle:

> "So I went over much grass and many flowers and among all kinds of wholesome and delectable trees till lo! in a narrow place between two rocks there came to meet me a great Lion. The speed of him was like the ostrich, and his size was an elephant's; his hair was like pure gold and the brightness of his eyes, like gold that is liquid in the furnace. He was more terrible than the Flaming Mountain of Lagour, and in beauty he surpassed all that is in the world, even as the rose in bloom surpasses the dust of the desert. Then I fell at his feet and thought, Surely this is the hour of death, for the Lion (who is worthy of all honour) will know that I have served Tash all my days and not him. Nevertheless, it is better to see the Lion and die than to be Tisroc of the world and live and not to have seen him. But the Glorious One bent down his golden head and touched my forehead with his tongue and said, Son, thou art welcome. But I said, Alas, Lord, I am no son of Thine but the servant of Tash. He answered, Child, all the service thou hast done to Tash, I account as service done to me. Then by reason of my great desire for wisdom and understanding, I overcame my fear and questioned the Glorious One and said, Lord, is it then true, as the Ape said, that thou and Tash are one? The Lion growled so that the earth shook (but his wrath was not against me) and said, It is false. Not because he and I are one, but because we are opposites, I take to me the services which thou hast done to him, for I and he are of such different kinds that no service which is vile can be done to me, and none which is not vile can be done to him. Therefore if any man swear by Tash and keep his oath for the oath's sake, it is by me that he has truly sworn, though he know it not, and it is I who reward him. And if any man do a cruelty in my name, then, though he says the name Aslan, it is Tash whom he serves and by Tash his deed is accepted. Dost thou understand, Child? I said, Lord, thou knowest how much I understand. But I said also (for the truth constrained me), Yet I have been seeking Tash all my days. Beloved, said the Glorious One, unless thy desire had been for me thou wouldst not have sought so long and so truly. For all find what they truly seek.

At the end of the day, however, it was obvious that there would be no two ways to finding God. You see... there's a responsibility that comes with knowing the truth. You can either ignore it or use it and each choice has its consequences.

> And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
>
> **John 8:32**

And **there**... is where you found me. I know, ever so clearly, what the truth is or should be... but I'm stuck at getting it to set me free.

I'll be quite honest now. Some of the things I'll say may be quite hurtful... but they're true, and there's no escaping that.

One of the things frightens me out of my wits is that I'll let you too close and that you'll see how weak I am and how some of my thought process escapes the logic that I seem to hold so firmly to. I'm also scared that you'll see me say and do completely different things.... that you'll see me mess up and think less of me.

I'm also scared that I'll make compromises in trying to please you... and that I'll end up just as lost and confused as I felt before I met you. The God that I'm trying to find calls men to love Him above all else. If we're headed in different directions, that's going to present a huge challenge eventually.

> Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
>
> **Matthew 22:37**

That's the quandary that I find myself in. I'll probably never really know if it was a great idea to tell you how I felt towards you... because now it seems like it's done more harm than good. The one nice thing that's come out of it is that it gave me the oppurtunity to be honest with you. I'd really like to know you much better... but I can't commit to something that's bound to blow up in the end, more-so because there's the significant chance that I'd hurt you more than I already have.

I really value your company and I'd still like to be friends... with limits. Even though I'm a huge mess I still think that I've seen the love and joy that Christ can bring... and I'd like to share that with you... if you'd be so willing. I'm not a huge believer in forcing people to believe... largely because I was force-fed the Gospel for a large part of my life. I'd still really like to show you the nice parts of what I've experienced and experience some of it with you.

There's really no pressure though... whatever you decide... I'm still your friend.
