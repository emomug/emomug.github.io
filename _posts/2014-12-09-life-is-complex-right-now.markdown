Hello Stranger.

Life's been a little complex lately. I'm not really sure why.

I'll just give you a torrent of information and hopefully you can help figure things out.

In exactly 9 days I'll finish my final exam in [JKUAT][j_id]... assuming all goes well. I think that should be a good thing... in more ways than one: It's been a long five years. Engineering didn't really turn out as expected it would be when I applied. Instead of becoming an awesome inventor and becoming 'The Best Programmer ever!', I'm that guy who couldn't get his project to work on time for demonstratioins. I'm also the guy who's practically given up on understanding the stuff that we learn in school... I've become just another expert in the art of getting by.

When I was a kid I'd tell people that I wasn't ready for a girlfriend. I did, however, tell them that I'd be ready when I hit 20. In between puberty and losing all hope in the existence of love, I somehow didn't forget this... Sure enough, in 2nd year, love struck... or at least I thought so. She was beautiful, she understood me, she was unlike anyone I'd ever met and I thought she liked me too.

I'll cut what could be a long story short. It didn't really work out. I hit 21 and I was still all alone in the world, like an electron revolving about some far away nucleus... never to know any of the others spinning around in their own forelone journeys. She wasn't ready, I was... or at least I thought I was. It broke my heart. Boom! It hadn't happened before and I obviously didn't know how to react. Naturally, I proceeded to screw things up in epic proportion.

Somewhere along the line, she was ready... or at least she thought she was, but I was still hurt and confused: So I did what I always do when I don't know what to do... I procrastinated. I put off talking to her, tried to find someone new, tried to distract myself with work... just anything but talking to her.

One day I woke up and she was gone. He was a really nice guy. I couldn't find the slightest reason that they shouldn't be together. It hurt... really bad... perhaps as bad as the first time she said no. Luckily, I'd had some time this time: Time to realize that even though she was a phenomenal person... Love is a choice... and that some day I could choose to love someone else.

One choice that I made, perhaps a little too hastily, was not to procrastinate again. It seemed like a really good idea at the time. A friend told me to get off my ass and do something about what I feel... should I choose to feel.

There was this girl. She was, to be honest, quite captivating. She read books... books I didn't read. She sang... she sang beautifully. She smiled, she laughed and danced... while I was a frowny old fart.

While I'm being honest... I also didn't know quite a lot about her. We'd talked briefly from time to time... but I was distracted by the other one back then. I had a single-track mind back then; nothing could distract me from my goal. But one day I sat next to her in a concert and I had a good time... for what felt like the first time in a long long time.

I thought that I'd forget about her after the concert... that she was just a temporary distraction. A whole semester went by and I was **this** close to forgetting... then I met her again, and her smile filled the room. It was really the worst time to meet her... I was in the dumps and life was mostly a pile of complicated mush I couldn't handle. Then, there she was.

Acting on my new policy of non-procrastination... I asked her out for coffee. I'd never been so forward before. I'd never even had a single date with the other one before. I thought... I wasn't thinking... I just decided to do something. It paid off to a degree: Life felt a little less futile when I knew there was someone I could talk to if I needed to. Something was missing though...

Then yesterday, I met her #3 again. She was writing... I only read a sentence, "Life has been really complicated lately". I didn't know what to feel. I've known her for a bit now... but I've never really known her... never poked at her brain. I realized in a fraction of a second that there was someone who could be spectacularly interesting but I'd never get to know them... I'd graduate and fall in love with her #2 and never think two thoughts about her #3 again.

I didn't... I don't know what to do. I guess that's part of the reason why I went looking for her in studio today. I thought that I could answer some of my questions before it's too late. Fate, being the old meany that he is, decided that we shouldn't meet... and that's the reason I'm up here on the bucket seats typing away on my Dell.

Thank you kind stranger, for listening to my problems. Hopefully, I'll figure out something eventually.
