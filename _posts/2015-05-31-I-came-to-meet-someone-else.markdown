I came to meet someone else,
I was a man on a mission,
I knew what I wanted,
Half insane, half god.

I came to meet someone else,
But she wasn't there,
I didn't have what I wanted,
Half confused, half alone.

I came to meet someone else,
But there she was,
Doing, saying what she wanted,
Part sunshine, part orange juice.

I came to meet someone else,
But I'm talking to her now,
She might be what I wanted,
The part I never found.
